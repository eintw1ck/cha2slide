## What is ChaChaSlide?

A PNG Encoder with symmetric encryption based on blake2b and chacha20.

## Why though?

I wanted to create something fairly light (hence the choice of C) which could be used on Camera firmware for encryption of images on-device for journalism, or photography in high risk environments like warzones.

## Why is it so bad/buggy?

I made it as a proof of concept for a high school project.
